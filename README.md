FUEL ADMIN MODULE
by Nathan Harper

Hey! I hope to make this more complete eventually, but here's a prelim list of what's needed to install this module:

1. Smarty. (I'll find the link to this package and put it here eventually...)
2. ffmpeg and imagemagick are desirable
3. A title named 'admin.php' in fuel/app/config with your projects settings (details forthcoming...)
4. NO POOFTERS! (just kidding, this module does not discriminate based on sexual orientation).
5. All model classes being displayed in admin are expected to have a public static admin_config() function (details forthcoming...)
6. jQuery is NOT included in the module, and IS required to work, so point to the correct jquery file in admin.config
7. That's it? I'll write more as I think of it.
